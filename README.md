# MultiSocketServerFX

MultiSocketServerFX is a simple JavaFX 2.x based UI application (generated with
FXML) representing the server end of a socket connection.  It is capable of
handling multiple socket clients on the same port.  Used in conjunction
with one or more SocketClientFX instances, these programs visualize how data 
is passed between sockets.

**** NOTE: This application has a dependency on the com.jtconnors.socket
project which can be downloaded from via git from:
https://github.com/jtconnors/com.jtconnors.socket.git
